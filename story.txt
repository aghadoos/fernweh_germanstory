It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
I ditched my crashed car and headed to Oktoberfest, because Iâ€™m too wettbewerbsfaehig to let Melhase have all the fun.
To get back to Oktoberfest, I decided to rent a Porsche to get back to the Haupstrasse quicker and ate an apfelkuchen on the way.
