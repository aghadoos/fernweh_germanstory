It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
It's ok though, my lack of lederhose is made up by the amount beer I can drink in the biergarten.
