It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
I ditched my crashed car and headed to Oktoberfest, because Iâ€™m too wettbewerbsfaehig to let Melhase have all the fun.
I got my hund and some gebaeck to cheer me up as I walked down the hauptstrasse.
As I walked down the hauptstrasse, I passed a building reminicent of Schloss Eltz, I pondered "That's an odd place for a Schloss."
When I got closer, I realized it was a Flughafen so I booked a ticket to Berlin.
As I sat in my seat, I wondered how I could have confused a Flughafuen with a Schloss. Maybe if I would have gotten the Porche instead, the concussion wouldn't be so bad.
I reminded myself to go straigth to this particular ratskeller with an amazing biergarten once I landed in Berlin.  I can cure my concussion by getting drunk before noon.
