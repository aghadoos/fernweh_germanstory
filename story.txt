It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
I decided to rent a Porsche to go back to my schloss, hoping no one has taken my lederhose yet.
